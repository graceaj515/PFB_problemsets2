Irene by Shel Silverstein

Irene loves me,
Irene cares,
Irene picks me peaches and pears.
Irene offers me candy and Cokes,
Irene listens and laughs at me jokes.
Irene helps when I get in a fight,
Irene does all my homework at night.
Irene misses me,
Irene cries,
Irene thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Irene is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Irene just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Irene's hand,
In the darkness where Irene usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Irene's gone!
